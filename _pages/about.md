Hi, I am Tawsif! I am an analytics professional currently working for Aimia, supporting the Amex and CIBC Aeroplan portfolios. Before Aimia, I was with PriceMetrix doing analytics for some of the major wealth managements firms in North America.

I was born in Bangladesh, and after completing my Bachelor in Electrical Engineering, I moved to Canada for my Master of Mathematics program at University of Waterloo. 

I am passionate about mathematics and the application of it to deliver rigorous actionable analytics. I am inquisitive in nature and enjoy research, mathematical analysis and solving problems that require critical thinking. Over the coming years, my goal is to develop my understanding of different industries where decisions are data driven.

Always keen on meeting people to have a chat, so feel free to contact me!
